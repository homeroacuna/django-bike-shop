# django-bike-shop
 Simple Django project to run a bike shop.
 
 1. Create your superuser running cmd ```python manage.py createsuperuser```
 
 2. Run the server locally and add materials for bikes from the admin page: frames, seats, tires and baskets.
 
 3. Create bike models using these materials.
 
 4. Access the bikes index at localhost:8000/bikes, navigate through the bikes and submit orders.
 
 
 Bikes without enough materials can't be ordered.
 
 Materials are consumed upon ordering, remember to load more from admin page.
